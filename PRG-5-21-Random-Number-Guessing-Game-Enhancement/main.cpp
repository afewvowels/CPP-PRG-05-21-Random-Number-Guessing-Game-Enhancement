//  Enhance the program that you wrote for 5.20 so it keeps count
//  of the number of guesses the user makes. When the user correctly guesses the random
//  number, the program should display the number of guesses.
//
//  Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the
//  number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should
//  display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the
//  program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that
//  repeats until the user correctly guessees the random number.
